					<h2>Arctic Black Carbon</h2>
					<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's efforts in support of the Arctic Black Carbon Initiative (ABCI) sought to minimize BC emissions from existing 
						equipment in countries that impact the Arctic environment. To accomplish this the following objectives were pursued: </p>
					<p>Identify the location of BC emissions sources to enable strategic deployment of emissions control technologies to the sources;

						Improve estimates of BC emissions in the regions surrounding the Arctic with an emphasis on District Heating and Cooling (DHC) and 
						Combined Heat and Power (CHP) sources by working with a range of researchers and stakeholders to fill in the gaps of the existing
						available emissions inventory, and perform data assurance and quality control;
					
						Assess BC emissions reduction opportunities at district heating, power generation and/or industrial sites in Russia and encourage the adopt
						ion of highly-efficient, low-emissions CHP and DHC systems through a demonstration project and targeted educational outreach.
					
						Due to a series of international events culminating in the June 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from the Ukraine,
						the DOE project changed course with respect to the third objective and focused more effort on outreach.</p>
					</p>	

					<h3>Data We Use</h3>
					<p>The <a href='https://htap.org/'>Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP)</a> is an international scientific cooperative effort to 
						improve the understanding of the intercontinental transport of air pollution across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
					<p>Community Earth System Model (CESM version 1.0) was a state-of-the-art model used for the global climate simulation, including four major 
						components: atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea ice.
					</p>
					<p>Air Benefit and Cost and Attainment Assessment System" <a href='http://abacas.see.scut.edu.cn/abacas/Default.aspx'>(ABaCAS)</a>is being developed by an elite team of "Sino-US" scientists 
						aimed at providing policy makers and scientists in China with a user-friendly system framework for conducting integrated assessments of emissions
						 control cost and their associated air quality attainment and health benefits.
