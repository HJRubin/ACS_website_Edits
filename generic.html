					<p class = p2>Heat Waves</p>
					<p>It is well accepted that heat waves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration due to climate change; 
						however, predictions of the region-specific risks from heat waves remain limited. We carry out a systematic investigation on heat waves in the US
						 at a regional scale from 2020-2059 under the high-emissions climate scenario SSP5-8.5 using two separate ensembles of six dynamically and 
						 statistically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. We also investigate several thresholds for determining what
						  qualifies as a heat wave by region and compare our work to National Weather Service heat wave advisories from 2005-2019. We show that humidity 
						  and overnight temperatures will increase in the near future, which will exacerbate the health impacts of heat waves.</p>

					<p class = p2>Nitrogen Deposition</p>
					<p>Global reactive nitrogen (N) deposition has more than tripled since 1860 and is expected to remain high due to land use changes and fossil fuel 
						consumption. We update the 2010 global deposition budget for nitrogen and sulfur with new regional wet deposition measurements from Asia, improving 
						the ensemble results of eleven global chemistry transport models from the second phase of the United Nation’s Task Force on Hemispheric Transport 
						of Air Pollution (HTAP-II). The observationally adjusted global N deposition budget is 130 Tg-N, representing a 10% increase and the adjusted global
						 sulfur deposition budget is 80 Tg-S, representing no change. Our study demonstrates that a global measurement-model fusion approach can 
						 substantially improve N and S deposition model estimates at a regional scale and represents a step forward toward the World Meteorological 
						 Organization’s goal of global fusion products for accurately mapping harmful air pollution. </p>

					<p class = p2>Wildfires</p>
					<p>Wildfires have become serious environmental and societal issues, causing great property losses and endangering human lives and ecosystems. 
						Multiple climate intervention strategies have been proposed to offset further warming brought on by elevated anthropogenic emissions, which induce 
						a higher potential for adverse environmental impacts including fires. However, as vegetation productivity increases due to CO2 fertilization in a 
						cooler climate created through solar radiation management, biomass that serves as available fuel load increases in an intervened climate, 
						causing a more severe burning activity once fires occur. We investigate how fire activities evolve from the past to the future climate both at global and ecoregional scales.</p>
					<p class = p2>Sulfur Deposition</p>
					<p>The widespread harmful impacts to humans and ecosystems are being felt 
						worldwide and current pledges to reduce emissions are not adequate to even maintain warming at 2 degrees C above historical temperatures. 
						In addition to reducing emissions and adapting to a warmer climate, climate intervention may be needed to slow warming. Decreasing radiative 
						forcing does not address the fundamental issue of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but it would give the world more time to reduce and
						 stabilize emissions. One method of altering the atmosphere’s radiative budget is stratospheric aerosol injection. However, when sulfur dioxide is 
						 injected into the lower stratosphere, some of it will be deposited back onto land and marine environments. Therefore, it is important to evaluate 
						 the spatial and temporal patterns of sulfur deposition and its potential impacts on human and ecosystem health. </p>

					<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's efforts in support of the Arctic Black Carbon Initiative (ABCI) sought to minimize BC emissions from existing 
						equipment in countries that impact the Arctic environment. To accomplish this the following objectives were pursued: </p>
					<p>Identify the location of BC emissions sources to enable strategic deployment of emissions control technologies to the sources;

						Improve estimates of BC emissions in the regions surrounding the Arctic with an emphasis on District Heating and Cooling (DHC) and 
						Combined Heat and Power (CHP) sources by working with a range of researchers and stakeholders to fill in the gaps of the existing
						available emissions inventory, and perform data assurance and quality control;
					
						Assess BC emissions reduction opportunities at district heating, power generation and/or industrial sites in Russia and encourage the adopt
						ion of highly-efficient, low-emissions CHP and DHC systems through a demonstration project and targeted educational outreach.
					
						Due to a series of international events culminating in the June 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from the Ukraine,
						the DOE project changed course with respect to the third objective and focused more effort on outreach.</p>
